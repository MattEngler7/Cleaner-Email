### Directions:
In this exam, you may use a calculator and any number of lookup tables.  Such lookup tables should be restricted to the material provided to you via the Professor as part of the class materials.


### Encodings
1. Provide the binary encoding for the following values:
   1. The ASCII value: '['
      -                    <!-- response -->
   1. The MIPS register: $a0
      -                    <!-- response -->
   1. The MIPS 'func' code: add
      -                    <!-- response -->
   1. The Ocal value: 06343
      -                    <!-- response -->
   1. The Hexadeimal value: 0x9A186
      -                    <!-- response -->

### UTF-8 Packaging
1. Encode the following charater into UTF-8: U+9A186
   - 2#                          <!-- response -->
   - UTF-8:                      <!-- response -->
