1. We can use a Finite State Machine (FSM) to model the interaction between the OS and your program.
On a piece of paper, 
   - draw the Process Status Diagram (PSD)
   - label both it states and edges
   - upload a picture of your FSM
   - submit this picture with the name of PSD.png<br>

1. An ISA is an abstraction for a physical computer.  This abstraction includes five (5) characteristics.  Enumerate these 5 major characteristics.

1. A 'Universal Computer' is an abstract machine based upon the Turing Machine.  This computer has a standardized control program to manage the underlying finite state machine. (This control program is akin to the computer firmware).  Two other programs are placed on the tape.  What are these two other programs:
