Task: Write a MIPS subroutine to convert a 32-bit unsigned number into a sequence of ASCII characters.  Each of these ASCII characters are printed to stdout in turn.
The ASCII string created on stdout will be the corresponding (unsigned) decimal number, written in reverse.
The subroutine returns the number of characters printed.
