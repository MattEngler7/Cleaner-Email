# General Assignment Directions

## To Get Started
  1. Clone this repository to your computer.  
  2. Review the "assignment.md" file.
  3. Make a copy of this file, naming it "submission.md": ``cp assignment.md submission.md``

  5. Add this file to your local repository: ``git add submission.md``
  6. Commit this file to your local repository: ``git commit -m 'creating file'``
  7. Push the current contents of your local repository to remote repository: ``git push``

## Work on the Assignment
  1. Incrementally edit and submit your "submission.md" file
     - ``git add``, ``git commit``, and ``git push``
     - get into the habit of making incremental updates to your working assignments.
  2. Provide an response to all items that are meant to be provided.
     - an HTML comment tags ``<!-- response -->`` have been added to each line that requires a response.
     - your response should be placed to the left of the HTML comment.
  3. Use additional spacing to ensure your answer is _easy_ to read to maximize credit.
  4. Add additional information as you feel is necessary to maximize credit.
  5. Don't forget to do a final ``git push`` to make your final submission
     - You can view your submission.md file online to review your final formatted submission
